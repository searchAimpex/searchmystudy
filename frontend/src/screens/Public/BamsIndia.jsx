                    After completing Class 12, candidates who want to pursue a career in medicine can enroll in the Bachelor of Ayurveda Medicine and Surgery (BAMS). In India, BAMS is an undergraduate medical program based on Ayurveda, the traditional healing arts. The BAMS course covers all aspects of “Ashtanga Ayurveda,” as well as scientific advances in modern medicine and extensive practical training. The Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) is the governing body for admission to Ayurveda education at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, as well as the practice of Ayurveda medicine in India. Ayurveda is one of the oldest medical systems, dating back to Vedic times. Its treatment are known for the natural elements they contain and are based on the curative properties of herbs. Even the World Health Organization has set up a global forum to promote traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda. As a result, the Bachelor of Ayurveda Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) program has provided students with numerous promising opportunities.</p>
